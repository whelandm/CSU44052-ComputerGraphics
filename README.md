# CSU44052 - ComputerGraphics - Final Project
Final submission for Computer Graphics module. Full explanation as well as link to video demonstration included in the Final Report.

## Assignment Specification
Project must have the following basic functionality (60%):
* 3-dimensional objects and views. (note: fixed top-down orthographic view not allowed).
* Consistent scene environment (teapot on table, car on road, etc.)
* User interaction and camera-control (approx. 15%): user should be able to move around the scene using the keyboard and/or the mouse. At a minimum, implement moving forwards and backwards, turning left and turning right. Higher marks will be given for extra functionality (i.e. additional degrees of freedom of rotation of the camera).
* At least one, well designed hierarchical animated object, creature or vehicle (no marks for a nonsensical hierarchies). Minimum requirement of a single one-to-one hierarchy. Higher marks for more complex hierarchies (e.g., one-to-many hierarchy of 4 wheels on a car, etc.). (approx. 15%)
* Texture-mapping your models using an image file (e.g., jpg). Higher marks will be given for quality and quantity. (approx. 15%)
* Implementation of the Phong Illumination model (approx. 15%): a. 1 light source; b. Any type of light may be used (point, directional, spotlight); c. Normal must be transformed correctly; d. Shading must use a combination of ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting; e. Any shading model may be used (flat, Gouraud, Phong) as appropriate for yourscene rendering style

Advanced Features can include the following (40%):
* Advanced rendering/lighting effects
* Ray-tracing
* Advanced animation
* Non photorealistic rendering
* Collision detection
* Simulated dynamics or physics of any sort
* Intelligent Characters
* Great models that you made yourself
* Height-mapped terrain
* Procedurally generated terrain or meshes
* 3D “picking” to select game objects with the mouse cursor
* More advanced texturing effects; multi-texturing, environment-mapping, bumpmapping, specular-mapping, etc.
* Partially transparent geometry using alpha-blending
* Smoke of fog
* Crowds using boids or other
* On-screen control panels (using QT or other library)
* cube mapping for sky-boxes, environment mapping, or refraction
